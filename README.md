# Game: Text Adventure
A simple four-directional travel text adventure game based on a University tutorial for "Artificial Intelligence for Game Developers". Project is currently setup for use with C++ compiler v140 on Microsoft Visual Studio 2015, but the solution will work on other versions of the compiler and IDE without a problem.
